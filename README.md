# 🌈 Weather App

![Weather App Demo](link-to-demo-image-or-video)

I crafted this dynamic Weather App leveraging the prowess of **Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS,** and **TypeScript**. A special shout out to [freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkC_wYM_Co4&t=2s) and [@reactwithutkarsh](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqNFQNGowoREH6V7RTtzUkA) for their invaluable resources that guided my journey.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

Hi there! 👋 I recently embarked on a journey to refine my skills in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript by developing a dynamic weather application utilizing the Open Weather API. This app is capable of displaying weather and forecasts for any searched city or the current location, thanks to the navigator's geolocation object. 

The UI is crafted for simplicity and ease of use, streamlined by Next.js and styled swiftly with Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach. For state management, Jotai's minimalistic yet powerful atoms come into play, ensuring component-specific updates for an efficient rendering process. Moreover, React Query enhances the experience by managing data fetching, caching, and synchronization seamlessly.

**Why Jotai?** Jotai addresses React's extra re-render issues with a bottom-up approach inspired by Recoil. It simplifies state management by allowing atoms to derive and update each other, avoiding the complexity and overhead of multiple contexts or the need for memoization. Jotai stands out for its simplicity, offering a flexible solution to build complex state models with minimal API.
